# FastMelodies

### Usage
FastMelodies requires a working installiation of Java, and is only useful with an installation of both TeX in general and MusiXTeX specifically. Instructions for installing MusiXTeX, and on installing a suitable TeX distrobution, can be found at the [Werner Icking Music Archive](https://icking-music-archive.org/software/htdocs/Getting_Started_Four_Scenar.html). 

An example program that details the current syntax for writing FastMelodies code can be seen example-programs/sample.txt.

After compiling the FastMelodies program, simply use `java FastMelodies [filepath]` to convert your text file to a .tex file. From there, MusiXTeX provides a `musixtex [filename]` macro.
