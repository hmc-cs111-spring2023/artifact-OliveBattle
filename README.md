Todo: rewrite this to be a lot better

This Program requires the user to have MusixTeX (and, by extension, a TeX distrobution) installed on their local machine.

There are many different TeX packages. I used MacTeX, but windows users may want to use MiKTex or another distrobution, and Unix-like systems like Linux could consider TeXLive.
